The executable jar file for the application is located at : 
LibraryIMS > dist > LibraryIMS.jar

The application is built and uploaded without database so both the user and admin pages are available for reaching out to the app.

Additionally, application usage videos and database queries are provided in this zip file.
Videos are in the Librarian.pptx PowerPoint slideshow,
and the database queries are available in LibraryIMS > sql_backup.

If the jar file doesn't work, you can also try logging the following command in cmd or any terminals: 
java -jar "C:\Users\___\Desktop\libraryManagementSystem\LibraryIMS\dist\LibraryIMS.jar"
adjusting to your own computer username above
